Telegram bot based on pyTelegramBotApi was made to protect chats from bad language.
It was created on April 2024. To make it work you should get token from BotFather (official bot of Telegram), put it inside token variable at the 12th line and run the code.

The bot only works in groups. To enable or disable him you should write /ban. To set his name in this group, so you can call him, you should write /name "your name". To get this instruction write /start.

There are two ways to test the advertisement function. The easy way is to contact me in Telegram (@vladimirchechnev), so I will demonstrate it by using my group. The complicated way is to create a new group, then get its id, put it inside the advertisement_group_id variable, run the code and write something in the created group.
