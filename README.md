Telegram bot based on pyTelegramBotApi was made to protect chats from bad language.
It was created on April 2024. To make it work you should get token from BotFather (official bot of Telegram), put it inside token variable on the 12th line and run the code.

The bot only works in groups. To enable or disable him you should write /ban. To set his name in this group, so you can call him, you should write /name "your name". To get this instruction write /start.
